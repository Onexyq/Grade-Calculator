# Grade-Calculator
This is my personal PIC 10C assginment

The assignement description can be found at

In my assignment, the calculator computes both Pic 10B and 10C grade, based on two different grading schema for each.

For PIC 10B
Schema A: Overall = HW*25% + Midterm1*15% + Midterm2*15% + Final*45%
schema B: Overall = HW*15% + Midterm1*10% + Midterm2*10% + Final*65%

For PIC 10C
Schema A: Overall = HW*25% + Midterm*30% + Final*45%
Schema B: Overall = HW*15% + Midterm*25% + Final*65%
